- Biographical details

I’m currently a postdoc in AIDS and Molecular Immunology Lab at Oswaldo Cruz Institute/Fiocruz in Rio de Janeiro – Brazil. During my Ph.D., I have studied the molecular diversity and evolution of HIV in Brazil and other world regions, mainly the African continent. 
Recently, I expanded my interests to include the study of the emergence, spread, and pathogen-host interactions of other viruses in order to reduce their burden. My primary focus is on the RNA viruses, such as HIV, Yellow fever virus, Chikungunya virus, and Zika virus.
I believe the importance of collaboration for the contribution of scientific progress. In this way, I am always open to collaborating. If you have an interest in my work, feel free to contact me.

- Research interests

I’m interested in the evolutionary dynamics of infectious diseases, to try to elucidate their emergence and spread determinants through molecular genetics techniques.
