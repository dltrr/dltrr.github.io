**Abstract**

>In this study, the effect of glycine betaine as osmoprotectant compound for <i>Gluconacetobacter diazotrophicus</i> PAL5 was evaluated by kinetic growth parameters. Batch fermentation assays were performed employing media supplemented with different sodium chloride concentrations to simulate saline stress conditions. Salt concentrations of 50–300 mM led to decreased cell concentrations, while the maximum specific growth rates and cell productivities were reduced at concentrations above 100-mM NaCl. Salt inhibition was mainly observed in media with 200- and 300-mM NaCl, in which drastic changes in cell morphology were also noted. The addition of glycine betaine to the media showed to be efficient to counteract the salt inhibitory effect by increasing some fermentation parameters. However, the osmoprotectant was not able to revert the polymorphism promoted by higher salt concentrations.
