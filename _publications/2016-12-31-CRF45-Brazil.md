**Abstract**

>The HIV-1 epidemiology has changed over the past decade toward a marked increase in the circulation of strains previously restricted to local epidemics. Recent molecular epidemiological surveys identified some HIV-1 strains of probable African origin circulating in Brazil, including the Circulating Recombinant Form (CRF) 45_cpx, a complex A1/K/U recombinant that circulates in Central Africa. Here, we characterize partial genomic sequences and reconstruct the evolutionary history of HIV-1 CRF45_cpx-related recombinant samples identified in independent studies carried out with HIV<sup>+</sup> individuals in Brazil. The sequences were obtained by overlapping PCR amplifications followed by direct sequencing. Recombination profiles were determined by phylogenetic and bootscaning analyses. The evolutionary history was estimated by a Bayesian coalescent-based method using datasets representing the <i>gag</i>, <i>pol</i> and <i>env</i> gene fragments. Six of the 10 samples isolated in Rio de Janeiro showed a CRF45_cpx-like pattern throughout the sequenced genome. The remaining were classified as second-generation recombinants, showing the mosaic patterns: CRF45_cpx/B/D/F1/U, CRF45_cpx/B/F1/U, CRF45_cpx/B/U and CRF45_cpx/F1. All Brazilian CRF45_cpx sequences, except one, formed a monophyletic clade (CRF45-BR), which seems to be the result of a single introduction event that has spread to the Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo and Minas Gerais states and is related to sequences from Argentina, Italy and Belgium. The Bayesian analyses pointed out quite consistent onset dates for CRF45-BR clade (~1984: 1976–1996) in the three gene datasets. These results indicate that the CRF45-BR clade has been circulating in the Southeastern Brazilian region for about 30 years, although its presence was not detected until recently due to its very low prevalence. This reinforces the relevance of large-scale molecular surveillance data to identify the emergence of new HIV variants and their impact on local epidemics.
