**Abstract**

>The Northeastern Brazilian region has experienced a constant increase in the number of newly reported AIDS cases over the last decade, but the genetic diversity of HIV-1 strains currently disseminated in this region remains poorly explored. HIV-1 <i>pol</i> sequences were obtained from 140 patients followed at outpatient clinics from four Northeastern Brazilian states (Alagoas, Bahia, Ceará, and Piauí) between 2014 and 2015. Subtype B was the most prevalent HIV-1 clade (72%) detected in the Northeastern region, followed by subtypes F1 (6%), C (5%), and D (1%). The remaining strains (16%) displayed a recombinant structure and were classified as follows: BF1 (11%), BC (4%), BCF1 (1%), and CRF02-AG like (1%). The 20 HIV-1 BF1 and BC recombinant sequences detected were distributed among 11 lineages classified as follows: CRF28/29-BF like (n=5), CRF39-BF like (n=1), URF-BF (n=9), and URF-BC (n=5). Non-B subtypes were detected in all Northeastern Brazilian states, but with variable prevalence, ranging from 16% in Ceará to 55% in Alagoas. Phylogenetic analyses support that subtype D and CRF02-AG strains detected in the Northeastern region resulted from the expansion of autochthonous transmission networks, rather than from exogenous introductions from other countries. These results reveal that HIV-1 epidemic spreading in the Northeastern Brazilian region comprised by multiple subtypes and recombinant strains and the molecular epidemiologic pattern in this Brazilian region is much more complex than originally estimated.
