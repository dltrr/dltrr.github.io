**Abstract**

>HIV-1 CRF02_AG is the most prevalent intersubtype recombinant form worldwide. Six HIV-1 samples from patients living in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, were subtyped as CRF02_AG at the pol gene between 2004 and 2011. To trace the origin of these viruses, they were compared with 793 CRF02_AG pol sequences of African origin and another four Brazilian CRF02_AG pol sequences previously described. Phylogenetic analysis reveals that there have been at least four introductions of the CRF02_AG clade in Brazil, as signified by the presence of four phylogenetically distinct lineages, probably originated from western African countries (Benin, Ghana, and Guinea-Bissau). At least two CRF02_AG Brazilian lineages were successful in getting established and disseminated throughout the Rio de Janeiro state, with evidence of both horizontal and vertical transmission. Continuous epidemiological surveillance of HIV-1 strains circulating in Brazil is of paramount importance to the early detection of newly emerging viral lineages.
