**Abstract**

>Descriptive clinical data help to reveal factors that may provoke Zika virus (ZIKV) neuropathology. The case of a 24-year-old female with a ZIKV-associated severe acute neurological disorder was studied. The levels of ZIKV in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were 50 times higher than the levels in other compartments. An acute anti-flavivirus IgG, together with enhanced TNF-alpha levels, may have contributed to ZIKV invasion in the CSF, whereas the unbiased genome sequencing [obtained by next-generation sequencing (NGS)] of the CSF revealed that no virus mutations were associated with the anatomic compartments (CSF, serum, saliva and urine).
